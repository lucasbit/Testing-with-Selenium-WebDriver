Testing trening

Hi!, this is my testing-trening repo for tasks from Q-A curses

the exercises will be stored in separate files, so lesson 2 > exercise 1 can be found in l2t1.js and lesson 2 > exercise 3 can be found in l2t3.js

I using XAMPP and local hosting for e-commerce platform Lite Cart, and all tasks will conducted on it.

To run test you need to navigate to correct folder, and then run it through
node.js
